  <h1>- Hearty Homemade Lasagna -</h1>
  <img src="../img/lasagna" alt="Lasagna">
  <p>This hearty homemade lasagna is the perfect comfort food for a cold winter day. Start by cooking the pasta noodles according to the package instructions. In a separate pan, brown some ground beef and add in diced onions, garlic, and your choice of vegetables. Stir in a can of crushed tomatoes and some Italian seasoning. In a separate bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, an egg, and some chopped fresh basil.</p>
  <h2>How to Prepare:</h2>
  <p>To assemble the lasagna, spread a layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Top with a layer of cooked pasta noodles, followed by a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat this process until all of the ingredients are used up, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the top. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</p>
